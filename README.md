Implementing a Shell\
-Group members:\
    Jamie Gallegos II\
-List of files:\
makefile - instructions to run the file shellmain.c\
shellmain.c - all the main shell program is in here including the "built-in" commands\
-How to compile:\
I compile my program by typing make which will compile shellmain.c with the flags I have set\
-How to run:\
You can use make run to instantly run shellrun or you may use ./shellrun after you compile\
-Challenges encountered:\
I think the biggest struggles I ran into was understanding fork and creating a new process\
-Any sources used to help write programs/scripts\
I initially used the skeleton code given from project 1 lecture and built on it myself. I also used man pages to better understand some functions. Lastly, I used chatgpt to better understand some parts of code that still didn't make sense to me.
